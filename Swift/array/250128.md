### **Problem Description**
```
You are tasked with creating room number sets for a hotel. Each set of room numbers contains digits 0-9.
You need to calculate the minimum number of sets required to create a given room number, with the following special condition:
The digits 6 and 9 can be used interchangeably.

Example:
    Input:
        9999
    Output:
        2
```

### **Approach**
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the input string.
2. **Digit Count**:
   - Count the occurrences of each digit in the input string.
   - Handle the special case of digits 6 and 9 by treating them interchangeably (sum their counts and divide by 2).
3. **Find the Maximum**:
   - Determine the maximum count among all digits to find the minimum number of sets needed.
4. **Output**:
   - Print the minimum number of sets.

### **Code**
```swift
let input = readLine()!
var num = [Int](repeating: 0, count: 10)

for i in input {
    let n = Int(String(i))!
    num[n] += 1
}

num[6] = (num[6] + num[9] + 1) / 2
num[9] = 0

print(num.max()!)
```

* **Tag**: `Implementation`
* **Language**: Swift

### **Problem Description**
```
Given three integers A, B, and C, calculate their product and count the occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the result.

Example:
    Input:
        A = 150
        B = 266
        C = 427
    Output:
        3
        1
        0
        2
        0
        0
        0
        2
        0
        0
```

### **Approach**
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the three integers (A, B, C).
2. **Product Calculation**:
   - Calculate the product of the three integers.
   - Convert the result to a string for digit-wise processing.
3. **Digit Counting**:
   - Create an array to store counts of each digit (0-9).
   - Iterate through the string representation of the product and increment the corresponding count.
4. **Output**:
   - Print the count of each digit from 0 to 9.

### **Code**
```swift
var intCount = Array(repeating: 0, count: 10)

let A = Int(readLine()!)!
let B = Int(readLine()!)!
let C = Int(readLine()!)!

var ans: String = String(A * B * C)

for i in ans {
    intCount[Int(String(i))!] += 1
}

for i in 0..<10 {
    print(intCount[i])
}
```
