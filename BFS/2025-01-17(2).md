## Problem Description
Given an \(n \times m\) maze, each cell is either open (`1`) or blocked (`0`). Starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`, find the shortest path to the bottom-right corner `(n-1, m-1)`. Movement is allowed in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

---

## Approach
This problem can be solved using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

### Steps:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the maze dimensions (`n`, `m`) and the maze structure as a grid of strings.
2. **Initialization:**
   - Use a `dist` array initialized to `-1` to track the shortest distance to each cell.
   - Initialize a queue and start BFS from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`.
3. **BFS Execution:**
   - For each cell, explore its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If a neighbor is within bounds, has not been visited, and is an open cell (`1`), update its distance and enqueue it.
4. **Output the Result:**
   - The distance to the bottom-right corner `(n-1, m-1)` is the shortest path length.

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define X first
#define Y second

string maze[102];
int dist[102][102];
int n, m;
int dx[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);

    cin >> n >> m;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> maze[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) fill(dist[i], dist[i] + m, -1);

    queue<pair<int, int>> Q;
    Q.push({0, 0});
    dist[0][0] = 0;

    while (!Q.empty()) {
        pair<int, int> cur = Q.front(); Q.pop();
        for (int dir = 0; dir < 4; dir++) {
            int nx = cur.X + dx[dir];
            int ny = cur.Y + dy[dir];
            if (nx < 0 || nx >= n || ny < 0 || ny >= m) continue;
            if (dist[nx][ny] >= 0 || maze[nx][ny] != '1') continue;
            dist[nx][ny] = dist[cur.X][cur.Y] + 1;
            Q.push({nx, ny});
        }
    }

    cout << dist[n - 1][m - 1] + 1 << "\n";
}
