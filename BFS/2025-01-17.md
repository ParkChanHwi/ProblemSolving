## Problem Description
```
Given a large canvas represented by a 2D grid, find the number of distinct "paintings" and the largest area among them. 
A "painting" is defined as a group of 1s connected either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). 
The area of a painting is the number of 1s it contains.


Example :
      
      Input:
              6 5
              1 1 0 1 1
              0 1 1 0 0
              0 0 0 0 0
              1 0 1 1 1
              0 0 1 1 1
              0 0 1 1 1
      output:  
              4
              9

```

## Approach
This problem can be solved efficiently using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Here's how the solution is structured:

1. Traverse through the entire grid.
2. For every unvisited cell with a value of 1, initiate a BFS to explore the connected cells, marking them as visited.
3. During each BFS, count the number of cells in the connected component to calculate the area of the painting.
4. Keep track of the number of paintings found and the maximum area encountered.

## Steps:
1. Input Parsing:
 - Read the dimensions of the canvas (n, m) and the grid data.
2. Initialization:
 - Use a 2D array vis to keep track of visited cells.
 - Define movement directions for BFS (dx and dy arrays).
3. BFS Execution:
 - For each unvisited cell with value 1, run a BFS.
 - Increment the painting count and calculate the area of the current painting.
4. Output Results:
 - Print the total number of paintings and the largest painting area.

## Code
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define X first
#define Y second
// 그림 valid = 1, 500x500

int board[502][502];
bool vis[502][502];
int n, m; // n is row, m is col

int dx[4] = { 1,0,-1,0 };
int dy[4] = { 0,1,0,-1 };

queue <pair<int, int>> Q;

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);
	//Mark : Input
	cin >> n >> m;
	int maxArea = 0;
	int countBoard = 0;


	for (int row = 0; row < n; row++) {
		for (int col = 0; col < m; col++)
		{
			cin >> board[row][col];
		}
	}

	//Find start point
		for (int row = 0; row < n; row++) {
			for (int col = 0; col < m; col++) {

				if (board[row][col] == 1 && vis[row][col] != 1) {
					vis[row][col] = 1;
					Q.push({ row,col });
					countBoard++;
				}
					//Mark : BFS
					int area = 0;
					while (!Q.empty())
					{
						pair<int, int> cur = Q.front(); Q.pop();
						area++;
						for (int dir = 0; dir < 4; dir++) {
							int nx = cur.X + dx[dir];
							int ny = cur.Y + dy[dir];

							if (nx < 0 || nx >= n || ny < 0 || ny >= m) continue;
							if (vis[nx][ny] || board[nx][ny] != 1) continue;

							vis[nx][ny] = 1;
							Q.push({ nx,ny });
						}
					}
					maxArea = max(area, maxArea);
			}
		}

		

		//Mark : output
		cout << countBoard << "\n" << maxArea;
}
